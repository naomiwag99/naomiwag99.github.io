    <p><strong>British comedy films</strong> are comedy films produced in the United Kingdom. 
        In the early 1930s, film adaptations of stage farces were popular. British comedy films 
        are numerous, but among the most notable are the Ealing comedies, the 1950s work of the
         Boulting Brothers, and innumerable popular comedy series including the St Trinian's films, 
         the Doctor series, and the long-running Carry On films. Some of the best known British film 
         comedy stars include Will Hay, George Formby, Norman Wisdom, Alec Guinness, Peter Sellers and 
         the Monty Python team. Other actors associated with British comedy films include Ian Carmichael, 
         Terry-Thomas, Margaret Rutherford, Irene Handl and Leslie Phillips. Most British comedy films of the 
         early 1970s were spin-offs of television series. </p>

            In the United Kingdom, film adaptations of stage farces were popular in the early 1930s,
             while the music hall tradition strongly influenced film comedy into the 1940s 
             with Will Hay and George Formby among the top comedy stars of the time. In England
              in the late 1940s, Ealing Studios achieved popular success as well as critical 
              acclaim with a series of films known collectively as the "Ealing comedies", 
              from 1947 to 1957. They usually included a degree of social comment, 
              and featured ensemble casts which often included Alec Guinness or Stanley Holloway. 
              Among the most famous examples were Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), 
              The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Ladykillers (1955).

            In the 1950s, the British film industry produced a number of highly successful film series, 
            however, including the Doctor series, the St. Trinian's films and the increasingly bawdy
             Carry On films. John and Roy Boulting also wrote and directed a series of successful satires, 
             including Private's Progress (1956) and I'm All Right, Jack (1959). As in the United States,
              in the next decade much of this talent would move into television.

            Norman Wisdom was cast in a series of comedy films produced between 
            1953 and 1966 featuring his hapless onscreen character that was often 
            called Norman Pitkin.

            In the late 1950s, as the United States, 
            the television industry has become a serious competition 
            over the film industry. So from the early 1960s, much of the British 
            comedies passes through television.

            One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film, 
            like Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), Sliding Doors (1998), and Notting Hill (1999). 
            Recent successful films, more representative of British humour were the working class comedies
             Brassed Off (1996) and The Full Monty (1997).
